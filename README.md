# Twitchbot-spam-
This is a somewhat spammy twitch bot that responds to keywords and phrases, set variables for keywords and phrases to have it respond.

this Javascript requires Node to run. https://nodejs.org/en/

It is also dependent on the "tmi.js" Node repo. https://github.com/tmijs

make a folder for the bot:

in terminal : 

npm i tmi.js

  Optionally if you are using a Linux distro.

  sudo apt install node.js

  npm i tmi.js

  cd "your dir"

  mkdir "foldername"
  
  Or cloning the repo using
  
  sudo git-clone https://github.com/fsty/Twitchbot-spam-.git
  
  ^ this also works if you are running the Linux kernel subsystem for Windows in 1903, assuming you have the dependencies.
